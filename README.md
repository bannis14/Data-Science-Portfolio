# Brett Annis - Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

üöÄ Welcome to my data-driven universe! As a finance professional turned data enthusiast, I've seamlessly blended the worlds of finance and technology to craft insightful narratives from complex datasets.


üí° Professional Journey:

Embarking on a journey that spans roles as an Indirect Tax Accounting Analyst and Accounts Payable Analyst, I've fine-tuned my skills in tax analysis, financial management, and data optimization. My              experiences extend from reconciling past-due accounts to leading teams in process improvement at Lower.com.


üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

Armed with a rich toolkit, including advanced Excel formulas, PowerBI, VBA programming, Python, and SQL, I've recently enhanced my capabilities through a comprehensive data science bootcamp with                  ZerotoMastery.com.


üìö Certifications:

I proudly hold certifications in Excel Basics, Business Intelligence, VBA Programming, Python, Data Analytics, Time Series Forecasting, Machine Learning, and Data Science. These certifications, coupled           with my practical experiences, form the backbone of my data expertise.


üåê What Drives Me:

Passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights, I bring a unique blend of financial acumen and tech prowess. Whether it's optimizing tax workflows or crafting creative solutions to complex            problems, I thrive on the intersection of data and innovation.


üéØ Next Adventure:

Currently exploring new opportunities in the data science realm, I am eager to contribute my skills to projects that demand a creative approach and a commitment to excellence.

Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together!

## Portfolio Projects
Explore my showcased projects that demonstrate my skills and passion for data:

### Volkswagen DieselGate Stock Price Analysis

**Code:** [Volkswagen_DieselGate_Stock_Price_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/bannis14/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Volkswagen_Causal_Impact_Analysis/Volkswagen_Deiselgate_Stock_Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine whether the revelation of the emission scandal had a discernible influence on the stock performance of VW.

**Description:** This project analyzes the potential causal impact of the Volkswagen (VW) emission scandal on the stock price of VW. Stock information was extracted and cleaned to form a training data set and perform exploratory data analysis. I then ran a causal impact analysis and visualized the results.

**Skills:** Causal Impact, Data Preprocessing, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Financial Analysis

**Technology:** Python, yfinance, Pandas, Matplotlib,Seaborn,CausalImpact

**Result:** It was determined through the analysis that the emissions scandal resulted in a decreased price by 25.58%

### Bulldozer Price Predictor

**Code:** [Bulldozer_Price_Predictor.ipynb](https://github.com/bannis14/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Bulldozer_Price_Predictor/bulldozer-price-predictor.ipynb)

**Goal:** In this notebook, our goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict future sales prices of bulldozers based on previous bulldozer sales data

**Description:** We used a dataset that compiled historical buldozer sales. I cleaned and extract relevant information and performed other EDA functions. When the data was in a satisfactory form, I built a baseline model using a `RandomForestRegressor` and evaluated its performance. Then I optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`. I compared the performance of the tuned model with the baseline, and evaluated key metrics (RMSLE).

**Skills:** Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation

**Technology:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

**Result:** The final model demonstrated strong performance in predicting bulldozer sale prices. Additional results and conclusion can be found in the notebook.
